        <h1>Siri Proxy</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>Siri Proxy is a proxy server for Apple's Siri "assistant." The idea is to allow for the creation of custom handlers for different actions. This can allow developers to easily add functionality to Siri. </p>

<p>The main example I provide is a plugin to control <a href="http://www.radiothermostat.com/latestnews.html#advanced">my thermostat</a> with Siri. It responds to commands such as, "What's the status of the thermostat?", or "Set the thermostat to 68 degrees", or even "What's the inside temperature?"</p>

<h2>Notice About Plugins</h2>

<p>We recently changed the way plugins work very significantly. That being the case, your old plugins won't work. </p>

<p>New plugins should be independent Gems. Take a look at the included <a href="https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/tree/master/plugins/siriproxy-example">example plugin</a> for some inspiration. We will try to keep that file up to date with the latest features. </p>

<h2>The State of This Project</h2>

<p>Please remember that this project is super-pre-alpha right now. If you're not a developer with a good bit of experience with networks, you're probably not even going to get the proxy running. But if you do (we are willing to help to an extent, check the IRC chat and my Twitter feed <a href="http://www.twitter.com/plamoni">@plamoni</a>), then test out building a plugin. It's very easy to do and takes almost no time at all for most experienced developers. Check the demo videos and other plugins below for inspiration!</p>

<h2>Find us on IRC</h2>

<p>We now have an IRC channel. Check out the #SiriProxy channel on irc.freenode.net.</p>

<h2>Demo Video</h2>

<p>See the system in action here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN6wy0keQqo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN6wy0keQqo</a></p>

<h2>More Demo Videos and Other Plugins</h2>

<p>For a list of current plugins and some more demo videos, check the <a href="https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/wiki/Plugins">Plugins page</a> on the wiki.  </p>

<p>This is a video of a complete start-to-finish installation on a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10. </p>

<p>The commands used in the video can be found at <a href="https://gist.github.com/1428474">https://gist.github.com/1428474</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Set up DNS</strong></p>

<p>Before you can use SiriProxy, you must set up a DNS server on your network to forward requests for guzzoni.apple.com to the computer running the proxy (make sure that computer is not using your DNS server!). I recommend dnsmasq for this purpose. It's easy to get running and can easily handle this sort of behavior. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9gO4L0U59s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9gO4L0U59s</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Set up RVM and Ruby 1.9.3</strong></p>

<p>If you don't already have Ruby 1.9.3 installed through RVM, please do so in order to make sure you can follow the steps later. Experts can ignore this. If you're unsure, follow these directions carefully:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and install RVM (if you don't have it already):

<ul>
<li>Download/install RVM:<br><code>bash &lt; &lt;(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)</code><br>
</li>
<li>Activate RVM:<br><code>[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] &amp;&amp; . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"</code><br>
</li>
<li>(optional, but useful) Add RVM to your .bash_profile:<br><code>echo '[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] &amp;&amp; . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM function' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile</code><br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install Ruby 1.9.3 (if you don't have it already):<br><code>rvm install 1.9.3</code><br>
</li>
<li>Set RVM to use/default to 1.9.3:<br><code>rvm use 1.9.3 --default</code>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>Set up SiriProxy</strong></p>

<p>Clone this repo locally, then navigate into the SiriProxy directory (the root of the repo). Then follow these instructions carefully. Note that nothing needs to be (or should be) done as root until you launch the server:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Rake and Bundler:<br><code>rvmsudo gem install rake bundler</code><br>
</li>
<li>Install SiriProxy gem (do this from your SiriProxy directory):<br><code>rake install</code><br>
</li>
<li>Make .siriproxy directory:<br><code>mkdir ~/.siriproxy</code><br>
</li>
<li>Move default config file to .siriproxy (if you need to make configuration changes, do that now by editing the config.yml):<br><code>cp ./config.example.yml ~/.siriproxy/config.yml</code><br>
</li>
<li>Generate certificates:<br><code>siriproxy gencerts</code>
</li>
<li>Install <code>~/.siriproxy/ca.pem</code> on your phone. This can easily be done by emailing the file to yourself and clicking on it in the iPhone email app. Follow the prompts.</li>
<li>Bundle SiriProxy (this should be done every time you change the config.yml):<br><code>siriproxy bundle</code>
</li>
<li>Start SiriProxy (must start as root because it uses a port &lt; 1024):<br><code>rvmsudo siriproxy server</code>
</li>
<li>Test that the server is running by saying "Test Siri Proxy" to your phone.</li>
</ol><p>Note: on some machines, rvmsudo changes "<code>~</code>" to "<code>/root/</code>". This means that you may need to symlink your "<code>.siriproxy</code>" directory to "<code>/root/</code>" in order to get the application to work:  </p>

<pre><code>sudo ln -s ~/.siriproxy /root/.siriproxy
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Updating SiriProxy</strong></p>

<p>Once you're up and running, if you modify the code, or you want to grab the latest code from GitHub, you can do that easily using the "siriproxy update" command. Here's a couple of examples:</p>

<pre><code>siriproxy update  
</code></pre>

<p>Installs the latest code from the [master] branch on GitHub.</p>

<pre><code>siriproxy update /path/to/SiriProxy  
</code></pre>

<p>Installs the code from /path/to/SiriProxy</p>

<pre><code>siriproxy update -b gemify 
</code></pre>

<p>Installs the latest code from the [gemify] branch on GitHub</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Will this let me run Siri on my iPhone 4, iPod Touch, iPhone 3G, Microwave, etc?</strong></p>

<p>No. Please stop asking. </p>

<p><strong>What is your opinion on h1siri, public SiriProxy servers, and other Siri "ports"?</strong></p>

<p>Glad you asked! Watch this: <a href="http://youtu.be/Y_Q6PfxBSbA">http://youtu.be/Y_Q6PfxBSbA</a></p>

<p><strong>How do I generate the certificate?</strong></p>

<p>Certificates can now be easily generated using <code>siriproxy gencerts</code> once you install the SiriProxy gem. See the instructions above.</p>

<p><strong>How do I set up a DNS server to forward Guzzoni.apple.com traffic to my computer?</strong></p>

<p>Check out my video on this: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9gO4L0U59s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9gO4L0U59s</a></p>

<p><strong>Will this work outside my home network?</strong></p>

<p>No, it won't. But, as suggested by STBullard on YouTube, you COULD VPN into your home network from outside your house in order to make this work. That would not require a jailbreak. Of course, it also means ALL your traffic gets funneled through your home network. The nice thing about adding an entry to your /etc/hosts file (on a jailbroken phone) is that it funnels only Siri traffic through your home network, and not all your traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Can you provide me with an iPhone 4S UDID?</strong></p>

<p>No. Don't even ask.</p>

<p><strong>I'm getting a bunch of "[Info - Guzzoni] Object: SessionValidationFailed" messages. What's wrong?!</strong></p>

<p>You're probably not using an iPhone 4S. You need to be using an iPhone 4S (or have a UDID you can sub in) in order to make use of SiriProxy. Sorry, this is not designed to be a way around that limitation. (Thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/brownie545">@brownie545</a> for providing information on what happens when you use a non-iPhone 4S)</p>

<p><strong>How do I remove the certificate from my iPhone when I'm done?</strong></p>

<p>Just go into your phone's Settings app, then go to "General-&gt;Profiles." Your CA will probably be the only thing listed under "Configuration Profiles." It will be listed as "SiriProxyCA" Just click it and click "Remove" and it will be removed. (Thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tidegu">@tidegu</a> for asking!)</p>

<p><strong>Does this require a jailbreak?</strong></p>

<p>No. The only action you need to take on the phone is to install the root CA's public key.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>I really can't give enough credit to <a href="http://applidium.com/en/news/cracking_siri/">Applidium</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/applidium/Cracking-Siri">tools they created</a>. While I've been toying with Siri for a while, their proof of concept for intercepting and interpreting the Siri protocol was invaluable. Although all the code included in the project (so far) is my own, much of the base logic behind my code is based on the sample code they provided. They do great work.</p>

<p>I also want to give a shout-out to <a href="http://www.archreactor.org">Arch Reactor</a> - my local Hackerspace. Hackerspaces are a fantastic place to go learn about stuff like this. I was able to get some help from folks there, and more importantly, I got encouragement to do stuff like this. Check <a href="http://www.hackerspaces.org">Hackerspaces.org</a> for a hackerspace in your area and make sure to check it out! </p>

<h2>Regarding Licensing</h2>

<p>Several people have come to me over the past few weeks about licensing. They (correctly) informed me that my <a href="https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/blob/2d7134fe93bd7b9281ceeda94a95f350d68f39b6/README.md">previous use</a> of the Creative Commons 3.0 <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">BY-NC-SA</a> license was a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F">bad idea</a>. That being said, I spoke with the other core contributors and we decided a change was in order. Going forward, SiriProxy will be licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">GNU General Public License v3.0</a>. In order to head off some confusion, here's a quick FAQ about the switch:</p>

<p><em>What does this mean for forks?</em></p>

<p>Good question. It is my totally-not-a-lawyer belief that the change in license affects all versions of the code starting with <a href="https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/commit/5f9d4a66b6c01488325680cbce59a5a3e69d0de7">this one</a>. </p>

<p>If you forked the project before this commit and you want to use the new license, I recommend (to be on the safe side, and remember, I'm totally not a lawyer) that you re-fork from this commit or a future one and then merge/patch in your changes. Should be pretty simple with Git.</p>

<p><em>What does this mean for public SiriProxy servers?</em></p>

<p>If you are selling public SiriProxy spots, then shame on you, you violated the spirit of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC license</a>. But good news, this new license lets you continue about your whacky ways without fear of legal recourse. As far as I'm concerned. If Apple calls, you are on your own. Read the "WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY" part of the GPL. You should probably pull the latest version of the code to use on your servers in order to be sure you're in 100% compliance.</p>

<p><em>What does this mean for end-users?</em></p>

<p>If you're using SiriProxy at home (like I am!), then you can do what you want. If you want to pull the latest code, that's cool. If you want to leave it as is, then that's cool too.</p>

<p><em>What does this mean for home automation companies that want to sell solutions based on SiriProxy</em></p>

<p>It's open season. You probably sell other services based on GPL licensed software (like Linux). So just do what you've always done. Keep up the good work. Home automation is awesome. Some of our most helpful bug reports came from a couple of home automation guys who hung out in our IRC chat. Working in home automation is totally going to be my retirement job. Keep me in mind if you have any job openings in 2045 or so.</p>

<p><em>Are you a lawyer?</em></p>

<p>No, I'm a programmer. So if you really seriously have real-life legal questions, you should go talk to someone with a real-life legal law degree. And a license to practice law. And the ability to advise you regarding copyright stuff.</p>
